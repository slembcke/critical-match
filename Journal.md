I was recently given an old computer from a neighbor that was cleaning out their basement. They knew I liked tinkering, and figured that maybe I wanted it. I tried to turn it down, but she maybe thought I was being polite and insisted. So there I was stuck with a on old PC that I was going to have to figure out how to recycle or something. It did occur to me that there might be something interesting on the hard drive, even if it's just some kid's 4th grade homework. I'd never had a chance to do any digital archeology, and thought "why not."

I plugged it in, flipped the switch. (It's been a long time since I've seen a computer with an actual hard switch on it.) The fans kicked on, and I heard the hard drive start clicking. (Remember when hard drive's weren't solid state? Haha!) Then... nothing. It was pretty clear it wasn't going to boot. The case was pretty easy to open, so I figured I would just pull the drive and hook it up to my computer. Long story short, most of the disk was corrupted, but what was still readable was the interesting part!

It turns out the computer had belonged to RCCom, the same company that developed the cult classic series of RC games for the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System). While most gamers of the time were unfamiliar with them, they had a super loyal following in the early 90's by developing gems such as RC Stunt Truck and RC Splash Race. It turns out this computer I was given had been used to develop their last, and unreleased game. In an interview with the RC Gamer magazine back in the day, they had described a secret collaboration with "some of the friendliest names in RC flight". Unfortunately, the NES era died out before they were able to finish the game, and it was never released.

I think we don't have to wait much more! Some of the files are corrupt, but there is enough there that I think I might be able to fill in the gaps and get it working again!

## Good news, bad news:

Unfortunately it looks like the latest build on the machine is unrecoverable. _However_ the source code database file is is pretty good shape, but unfortunately that means I'll have to recreate the code one revision at a time starting from the beginning. In a way it's sort of more interesting this way since I can experience the project from the start.
